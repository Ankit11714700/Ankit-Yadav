Operating system Assignment (Process Scheduler)  

Question-
 Considering 4 processes with the arrival time and the burst time requirement of the processes the scheduler 
 schedules the processes by interrupting the processor after every 6 units of time and does consider the completion
 of the process in this iteration. The schedulers then checks for the number of processes waiting for the processor 
 and allots the processor to the process but interrupting the processor after every 10 units of time and considers the
 completion of the process in this iteration. The scheduler after the second iteration checks for the number of 
 processes waiting for the processor and now provides the processor to the process with the least time requirement 
 to go in the terminated state. The inputs for the number of requirements, arrival time and burst time should be 
 provided by the user. 
 
Consider the following units for reference.
Process            Arrival time         Burst time 
P1                      0                  20 
P2                      5                  36
P3                     13                  19 
P4                     26                  42
